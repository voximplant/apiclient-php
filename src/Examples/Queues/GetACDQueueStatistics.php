 * @param array $params (See below)
 * from_date - Date and time of statistics interval begin. Time zone is UTC, format is 24-h 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss'
 * to_date - Date and time of statistics interval begin. Time zone is UTC, format is 24-h 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss'
 * abbreviation - Whether key names in returned JSON are abbreviated to reduce response byte size. The abbreviations are: 'WT' for 'WaitingTime', 'SA' for 'SpeedOfAnswer', 'AT' is for 'AbandonmentTime', 'HT' is for 'HandlingTime', 'TT' is for 'TalkTime', 'ACW' is for 'AfterCallWork', 'QL' is for 'QueueLength', 'TC' is for 'TotalCalls', 'AC' is for 'AnsweredCalls', 'UAC' is for 'UnansweredCalls', 'RC' is for 'RejectedCalls', 'SL' is for 'ServiceLevel', 'TWT' is for 'TotalWaitingTime', 'TST' is for 'TotalSubmissionTime', 'TAT' is for 'TotalAbandonmentTime', 'THT' is for 'TotalHandlingTime', 'TTT' is for 'TotalTalkTime', 'TACW' is for 'TotalAfterCallWork'
 * acd_queue_id - The ACD queue ID list separated by semicolons (;). Use the 'all' value to select all ACD queues
 * report - List of item names abbreviations separated by semicolons (;). Returned JSON includes keys only for the selected items. Special 'all' value defines all possible items, see [ACDQueueStatisticsType] for a complete list. See 'abbreviation' description for complete abbreviation list
 * aggregation - Specifies how records are grouped by date and time. If set to 'day', the criteria is a day number. If set to 'hour_of_day', the criteria is a 60-minute interval within a day. If set to 'hour', the criteria is both day number and 60-minute interval within that day. If set to 'none', records are not grouped by date and time
